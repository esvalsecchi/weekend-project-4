Weekend Project 4
==================

To consolidate this week's learning, complete the following project:

1. **Create a GitHub repository for your project**
   - Initialize a new GitHub repository.
   - Add all group members as collaborators to enable teamwork.

2. **Create a README.md file with a comprehensive project description**
   - Provide a detailed overview of the project, including its objectives, requirements, and instructions for running the application.

3. **Use the ts-playground as a foundation or develop a new application from scratch using Next.js**
   - You may start with the `ts-playground` as a base or create a new Next.js project from the ground up.

4. **Design a page with a single input field for .txt file uploads**
   - Users should be able to upload a `.txt` file containing a book or similar content with characters and settings.

5. **Implement a button to extract characters from the uploaded file**
   - Create a button that triggers the extraction of characters from the uploaded file.

6. **Develop a RAG pipeline to extract characters from the uploaded file**
   - Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to extract information about characters from the uploaded content.

7. **Each character should have a name, description, and personality**
   - Ensure the extracted characters are detailed with a name, description, and personality traits.

8. **Add a text area below the button to display the results**
   - Display the extracted character data in a text area on the page.

9. **Convert the output from the AI into an array of objects and present it in a table format**
   - Process the AI-generated output into an array of objects, then render it as a table for easy viewing.

10. **(Optional) Modify the retrieveandquery.ts file to use Structured Outputs to make it easier to process the response**
    - Consider modifying the `retrieveandquery.ts` file to implement structured outputs, simplifying the handling of AI responses.

11. **Integrate the ts-playground project with the story-telling-app**
    - Allow users to create new stories using imported characters, reusing their descriptions and personalities inside the stories generated by the AI.

12. **Submit your project through the designated submission form**
    - Ensure that your completed project is submitted through the appropriate form for evaluation.
